**Measuring Firm Performance Using Financial Ratios â€“ An XGBoost Approach**  

### ðŸ“Œ **Objective**  
The project focuses on predicting the financial performance of U.S. and Chinese tech firms by analyzing financial ratios. This comparative study involved 63 companies from each region listed on major U.S. stock exchanges.  

### ðŸ›  **Methodology**  
- **Data Collection**: Extracted and preprocessed data from the Wharton Research Data Service (WRDS), utilizing 63 financial ratios across six key categories: Capitalization, Efficiency, Financial Soundness, Liquidity, Profitability, and Valuation.
- **Modeling Technique**: Deployed **XGBoost**, a powerful machine learning model, for precise and scalable predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Addressed missing values, transformed data into actionable insights, and conducted correlation analysis to eliminate redundancy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.  

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Insights**  
- U.S. tech firms consistently outperformed Chinese firms across most financial metrics.  
- High accuracy rates of 99.6% (U.S. dataset) and 98.4% (Chinese dataset) demonstrated the model's reliability.  
- The project emphasized the importance of feature optimization and hyperparameter tuning in achieving robust predictions.  

### ðŸ”‘ **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Programming**: R, Python  
- **Libraries**: XGBoost, caret, tidyverse, corrplot  
- **Data Sources**: WRDS, custom financial datasets
